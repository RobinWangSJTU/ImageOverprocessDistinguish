# ImageOverprocessDistinguish
This is one of my academic research topics which aim to design an algorithm to automatically distinguish whether a photograph was over processed. 
This is a further study in the field of Image Quality Assessment(IQA). Trational IQA or, to be more accurate, full reference IQA evaluate the quality with a hypothesis that the original image is the best. While in dailylife, the original images are not always the best. That's why we need image processing. Especially when we take aesthetic influence into consideration. Photographers process their photos in order to get a good effect or to express their own idea. Image processing used to be a highly professional skill while now is pretty common. People make adjustment to their photos with professional software such as Photoshop, Lightroom and cellphone apps like VSCO and Instagram. But not all the users have a professional skill like in the old days. The photos sometimes become "strange" or "unreal" after processing. Hence, I think there is a need for something to help unskillful people find whether they have make a widely enjoyable photo.
